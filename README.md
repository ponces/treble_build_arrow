# ArrowOS GSI

## Build
To get started with building ArrowOS GSI, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) as well as [How to build a GSI](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/How-to-build-a-GSI%3F).
- Create a new working directory for your ArrowOS build and navigate to it:
    ```
    mkdir arrow; cd arrow
    ```
- Clone this repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ponces/treble_build_arrow -b arrow-13.0
    ```
- Finally, start the build script:
    ```
    bash treble_build_arrow/build.sh
    ```
